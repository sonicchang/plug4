blog post about management of plug 'n play art installation

This past summer I learned about the importance of fluffing. At Burning Man, fluffing is the task of taking care of the workers. Burning Man takes place in an environment that is harsh by any standard: hot, dry, dusty, windy, dry. 

I was a part of the team that brought a major art installation, Plug 'n Play, to Burning Man 2016. Our project was six wood frame structures, between 14 and 30 feet high, shaped like five quad electrical outlets and an extension cord plug. The structures would house art, music, video, and workshops, all about the five elements of hip hop. It was a success, and I was so proud of how our project was more than just something pretty to look at.

Burning Man participants are naturally disposed to "participate" and many participate by 

It occurred to me
about the importance of fluffing


that in order to get the job done, you have to fluff your team.

- know your success criteria
it wasn't our burn, it was leaving the playa with no trace, and returning all our rental equipment
but since the project was volunteer and donor-based, we also had to ensure participants felt our gratitude for having taken part. otherwise, we would have failed.


- good communication (clarity, responsiveness)
with a project that had team members in new york, austin, the bay area, portland, and los angeles, it was important to have a centralized way to communicate but even more important the effect the communication had on gaining more supporters. if you don't communicate, sometimes people will assume nothing's happening. in some cases, that was in fact true! but in most cases, there were many tracks moving forward.

- take care of yourself and others (physical burnout vs. just mental) fluffing

i've worked in an office environment all my professional life. compared to the playa, office environments are comfy. on playa, where the physical environment is harsh and unforgiving. dust, wind, heat, dehydration, physical exhaustion, etc. we would have people come by with drinks and snacks, and to say hey, take a break becaue the threat of physically exhaustion is real. but i reawluzed, it's the same in an office. they try to make it easy to just keep going. but the risk of burn out is still real.
