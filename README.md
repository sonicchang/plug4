blog post about management of plug 'n play art installation

the points i want to make are:
- know your finish line
it wasn't our burn, it was leaving the playa with no trace, and returning all our rental equipment


- good communication (clarity, responsiveness)

- take care of yourself and others (physical burnout vs. just mental) fluffing
