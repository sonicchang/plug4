blog post about management of plug 'n play art installation

the points i want to make are:
- know your success criteria
it wasn't our burn, it was leaving the playa with no trace, and returning all our rental equipment
but since the project was volunteer and donor-based, we also had to ensure participants felt our gratitude for having taken part. otherwise, we would have failed.


- good communication (clarity, responsiveness)
with a project that had team members in new york, austin, the bay area, portland, and los angeles, it was important to have a centralized way to communicate but even more important the effect the communication had on gaining more supporters. if you don't communicate, sometimes people will assume nothing's happening. in some cases, that was in fact true! but in most cases, there were many tracks moving forward.

- take care of yourself and others (physical burnout vs. just mental) fluffing

i've worked in an office environment all my professional life. compared to the playa, office environments are comfy. on playa, where the physical environment is harsh and unforgiving. dust, wind, heat, dehydration, physical exhaustion, etc. we would have people come by with drinks and snacks, and to say hey, take a break becaue the threat of physically exhaustion is real. but i reawluzed, it's the same in an office. they try to make it easy to just keep going. but the risk of burn out is still real.
